            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <p>I am really bad at picking out color (palettes), so this part was very useful for me. The two palettes cam out well too, I was proud of myself. I had never implemented a dark mode before, that was also easier than expected and will surely be useful in the future. </p>

            <h3>Animations</h3>
            <p>Animating stuff is fun, though I am always wary of doing some powerpoint-esque overkill animations. The moving underline was quite tricky to do. It made learn about the “::before” and “::after” pseudo-selectors which are useful. In the end I copied a solution from here. But as you said, copy as much as you can. I tried to capture it in a gif, but it will be better visible if you visit the page.</p>
