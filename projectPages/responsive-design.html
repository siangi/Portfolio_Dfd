            <p>This webpage is still ugly. The responsiveness is there though, which was the assignment, I guess. It was the first website I built according to the “mobile first” principle. I actually struggled with the amount of space I have on a desktop afterwards. I didn’t quite understand why we had to make all our images background-images. It made more sense to me to just use images at a size that works on all devices. I know we won’t have that luxury when we are working on a professional project, but why not do it while we can. I did do it properly when we used the frameworks to style the same page.</p>
