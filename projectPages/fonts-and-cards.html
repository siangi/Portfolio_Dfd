            <h3>Part one: Fonts</h3>
            <p>I really wanted ot somethig wild for my display font, because I think it can alter the vibe of a webpage very well. On google fonts i found this interesting font called "Kumar". With those cut off edges it kind of feels like a Fraktur script, but it still looks modern. </p>
            <p>The text font is Roboto. I tried Oswald at first until I heard that it's too condensed to be readable at that size. So I just picked Roboto as a safe choice</p>

            <h3>Part two: Cards</h3>
            <p>This card Design is inspired by a Design I found on collectui.com I like it because the layering of the component gives it depth and brings  the most important things to the front. I fiddled with the edges and typo for quite some time to make it work. I know the rounded corners donâ€™t fit into the rest of the page, but I lacked the motivation to change the rest of it. It looks horrible with sharp corners, so that was no option either.</p>
